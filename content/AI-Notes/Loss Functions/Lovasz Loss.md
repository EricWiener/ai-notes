The **Lovasz-Softmax loss** is a loss function for multiclass semantic segmentation that incorporates the [softmax](https://paperswithcode.com/method/softmax) operation in the Lovasz extension. The Lovasz extension is a means by which we can achieve direct optimization of the mean intersection-over-union loss in neural networks.
