The Elo rating system uses two formulas: 
- Predicting the outcome of the game, such as whether you're going to win or lose
- Updating your rating depending on whether you won or lost
Players with higher ELO ratings have a higher probability of winning a game than a player with lower ELO ratings.

The Elo rating system **measures the relative strength of a player in some games, such as chess, compared to other players**. Its creator, Arpad Elo, was a physics professor in the United States and a chess master who worked to improve the way the U.S. Chess Federation measured their players' skill levels.

It was used by [this](https://lmsys.org/blog/2023-05-03-arena/) paper to rank LLMs.
