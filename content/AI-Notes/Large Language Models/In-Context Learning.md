In-context learning (ICL) is **a specific method of prompt engineering where demonstrations of the task are provided to the model as part of the prompt (in natural language)**. With ICL, you can use off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) to solve novel tasks without the need for fine-tuning.

Example:
```
Translate the following German sentences into English:

Example 1:
German: "Ich liebe Eis."
English: "I love ice cream."

Example 2:
German: "Draußen ist es stürmisch und regnerisch"
English: "It's stormy and rainy outside.

Translate this sentence:
German: "Wo ist die naechste Supermarkt?"
```

In-context learning is a valuable and user-friendly method for situations where direct access to the large language model (LLM) is limited, such as when interacting with the LLM through an API or user interface.
