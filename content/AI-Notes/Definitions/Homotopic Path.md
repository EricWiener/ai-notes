In the context of motion planning, the term "homotopy" is used to describe paths or trajectories that can be ==continuously deformed into each other without colliding with obstacles== or violating constraints. Homotopic paths are used in motion planning to generate feasible collision-free paths for mobile robots.

In the diagram below, the paths on the left are in the same homotopic class since one can be deformed to the other without colliding with obstacles. The paths on the right are not in the same homotopic class since you can't deform one into another without hitting the orange obstacles.
