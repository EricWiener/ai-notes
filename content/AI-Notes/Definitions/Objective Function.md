The "objective function" is the function that you want to minimise or maximise in your problem.

For example, in machine learning, you define a model, $M$. To train $M$, you usually define a loss function $L$ (e.g., a mean squared error), which you want to minimise. $L$ is the "objective function" of your problem (which in this case is to be minimised).
