summary: Isotropic architectures have same scale and feature dimensions at every layer

- These are the opposite of hierarchial models.
- A [[ViT An Image is Worth 16x16 Words Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale|ViT]] is an example of an isotropic architecture (all blocks have the same resolution and number of channels) vs. a [[Convolutional Neural Networks|CNN]] which is a hierarchial architecture (resolution decreases and number of channels increases as you move deeper in the network).
