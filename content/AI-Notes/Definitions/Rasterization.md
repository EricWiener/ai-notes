Rasterization (or rasterisation) is **the task of taking an image described in a vector graphics format (shapes) and converting it into a raster image** (a series of pixels, dots or lines, which, when displayed together, create the image which was represented via shapes).

One example is converting a driving scene which is continuous into a rasterized top-down image where one pixel corresponds to a 0.2x0.2 meter space in the real world.
