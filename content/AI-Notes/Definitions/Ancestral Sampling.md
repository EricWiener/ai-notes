summary: ancestral sampling is used when you want to sample data that is conditioned on other data. You first sample from a distribution that isn't conditioned on anything and then sample from subsequent distributions conditioned on this value.

A process of producing samples from a probabilistic model by first sampling variables which have no parents using their prior distributions, then sampling their child variables conditioned on these sampled values, then sampling the childrenâ€™s child variables similarly and so on.

### StackExchange QA
**Q: Why is ancestral sampling used in autoregressive models?**

You can use ancestral sampling in all autoregressive models where the conditional probability distribution is known given the previous samples, e.g. $p(x_t \mid x_{t - 1}, \dots, x_1)$.

For example, consider a first-order Markov process:
$$x_1\rightarrow x_2\rightarrow \dots \rightarrow x_{t-1}\rightarrow x_t$$

The joint probability distribution would be $$p(x_1, \dots, x_t)=p(x_1)p(x_2 \mid x_1) \dots p(x_t \mid x_{t - 1})$$
Assume you know all the conditional probabilities/densities here. Then, you can generate an autoregressive process via first sampling $x_1$, then sampling $x_2$ from $p(x_2 \mid x_1)$, then $x_3$ from $p(x_3 \mid x_2)$, and so on, reaching up to $x_t$. You start sampling at the very ancestor and keep moving up.
