[LiDAR vs RADAR: Whatâ€™s the Difference?](https://flyguys.com/lidar-vs-radar/)

In general, LiDAR is considered to be more accurate than radar, especially at short ranges. However, radar has the advantage of being able to operate in a wider range of environmental conditions and at longer ranges. It is also generally less expensive to produce and implement than LiDAR.

### Radar:
Pros:
- Radar can detect objects through fog, rain, and other atmospheric conditions that can obstruct visibility for other sensors. 
- Radar is also capable of detecting objects at long ranges, making it useful in applications like air traffic control and military surveillance.
- Radar can provide accurate measurements of an object's velocity, direction, and distance.
- Radar works the same even in poor lightning conditions.

Radar can see around corners: "The radar signal hits the surface at an angle, so its reflection rebounds off like a cue ball hitting the wall of a pool table. The signal goes on to strike objects hidden around the corner. Some of the radar signal bounces back to detectors mounted on the car, allowing the system to see objects around the corner and tell whether they are moving or stationary."

Cons:
- Radar has lower resolution compared to other sensing technologies, making it difficult to distinguish between smaller objects and discern their details.
- The output of radar can be affected by interference, leading to false positives or negatives.
- Radar is not as effective in detecting non-metallic objects.

### Lidar:
Pros:
- Lidar can provide very high-resolution 3D data, allowing for accurate object detection and tracking, even in complex environments.
- Lidar can detect objects at long ranges, similar to radar.
- Lidar can work in low-light environments, making it useful in autonomous driving applications.

Cons:
- Lidar can be affected by weather conditions such as rain or snow, which can reduce its range and accuracy.
- Lidar is more expensive compared to other sensing technologies, making it less accessible for some applications.
- Lidar requires a clear line of sight to detect objects, which can be problematic in certain environments.

### Cameras:
Pros:
- Cameras provide high-resolution images and video, making them useful for object detection and recognition.
- Cameras are more affordable compared to other sensing technologies.
- Cameras are effective in detecting a wide range of objects, including non-metallic objects.

Cons:
- Cameras can be affected by lighting conditions, which can make it difficult to detect objects in low-light or high-glare situations.
- Cameras can be obstructed by obstacles like dirt, dust, or water droplets, leading to false positives or negatives.
- Cameras have difficulty detecting objects that are too far away, which limits their usefulness in certain applications.
