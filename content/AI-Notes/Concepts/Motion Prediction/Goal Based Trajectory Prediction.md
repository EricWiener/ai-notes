Goal based trajectory prediction methods will predict the goal(s) of an agent and then further complete the full trajectory for each goal. The key observation is that the goal (endpoint) carries the most uncertainty of the trajectory.

One example paper is [[End-to-end Trajectory Prediction from Dense Goal Sets|DenseTNT]] which improves on [[Target-driven trajectory prediction|TNT]].
