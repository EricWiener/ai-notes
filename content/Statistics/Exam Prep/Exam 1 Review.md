### Explain the difference between y, ŷ, and ȳ.

- y: the observed response, a value in the data set.
- ŷ: the predicted value of the response (y) found using the regression model at a given x.
- ȳ: the mean of all the response values in the data set.

### **Example Scatterplot Assessment:**

There is a strong, positive, linear relationship between sales price and living area for the homes in the ames50 data set. There are two homes with living areas above 3000 square feet that are a bit unusual (high leverage). The home with sales price just over $500,000 might be an outlier.

### What is the best estimate for the population mean?

You should use the sample mean. Even though the mean is more skewed by outliers, we want to know about the population mean, so we need to use the sample mean as our estimate.

### Example p-value conclusion

There is very strong evidence against the null hypothesis. Our results suggest that the proportion of students from urban/suburban backgrounds who pass the class is higher than the proportion of students from rural/small-town backgrounds who pass this course.

### Parameter or statistic

![[Exam 1 Rev/Screen_Shot 2.png]]

- This is a statistic because the population is more than the 15 patients

### Bar graph vs histogram

![[Exam 1 Rev/Untitled.png]]

- This is a histogram

### Random variable vs. statistic

# Random stuff

- Statisticians **don't like pie charts** because they don't provide a lot of data about counts of groups.
- Make sure to pay attention to whether you are testing if a p-value is less than, greater than, or beyond (if you just want to know if a difference exist).

- I was supposed to use $\hat{p}_E$ and $\hat{p}_N$ because these are sample proportions not population parameters.
