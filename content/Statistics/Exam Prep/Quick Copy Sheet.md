### P-Value

The $p$-value is defined as the probability of obtaining a value of the statistic at least as extreme as the observed statistic when the null hypothesis is true.

**Rejecting/Accepting**

Since our p-value is (**small/large**), we have (**strong/weak**) evidence against the null hypothesis. Thus we have (**strong/weak**) evidence to support that the true proportion of STATS 250 students who self-report consuming alcohol is (**greater than/less than/not equal to) 0.553**.
