# Homework 8

- A p-value of 0.09 means you have some evidence against the null hypothesis

Provide an estimate of the population mean time spent using apps for Generation X smartphone users.

- The correct answer is $\bar{x}$ = 205 minutes. The sample mean is a better estimate than the population average for a different population (I had chosen $\mu = 220$ incorrectly).

# Lab 9

- Remember to test the `mu` value when doing a `t.test()`: ex: `t.test(body_temp$temp, conf.level = 0.98, mu=98.6)` when the null hypothesis is $\mu = 98.6$

# Lab 10

- The symbol for the point estimate for the difference of two means is $\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2$ not $\mu_1 - \mu_2$
- Remember to plot "beyond" when the alternative hypothesis is $\ne$.

# Homework 10

To use a paired t confidence interval to estimate the population mean difference in responses, or to perform a paired t test regarding hypotheses about the population mean of the differences, there are some assumptions. Which of the following is a (are) required assumption(s)? Select all that apply.

- $t$-test doesn't require at least 30 pairs

# Exam 1

Q8.2: "Calculate the difference between the proportions..."

- I calculated $p_E - p_N$ when I should have done $\hat{p}_E - \hat{p}_N$ because we were finding the point estimate using the sample values.
