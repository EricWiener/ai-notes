- A random variable is a variable whose values are not fixed and depends on the outcome of an experiment or observation.
- A random variable is only random **before you see what the value of the variable is.** Once you see the value, there is nothing random.
- Random variables are often denoted by uppercase letters $X, Y, Z$ and their values by the corresponding lowercase letters $x, y, z$.
- For instance, we can think of the weight of an adult female golden retriever as a
random variable. The value of this variable depends on the particular golden
retriever we pick.

## Describing observations of a random variable

- When you repeatedly observe the values of a random variable, you can consider the distribution of those values (ex. describe with a histogram).
- The distgribution is referred to as the distribution of the random variable.
- You often model the distributions before conducting inference.

## Example: golden retriever weight

# Normal Scores

- You can standardize the distribution of random variables to have a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.
- You do this by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation

- You can also normalize an observed value with the same method.
- When you do this, the result is called a **z-score.** $z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$
- The area to the left of the raw value under the original curve is the same as the area to the left of the z-score under the normalized curve.
