- A **population** is the set of all data that is relevant to a study. For many reasons, it is not feasible to examine all the data.
- A **sample** is a subset of the population collected for the purpose of drawing inference about the population.
- Want the collected samples to be representative of the whole population.

### Probability vs. non-probability sampling

- Sampling techniques can be largely divided into two groups: **probability sampling** and **non-probability sampling.**
- In probability sampling, all eligible cases have a chance of being chosen, so you will be able to generalize the results from your study.
- In non-probability sampling, you don't start with a complete sampling frame, so some cases have no chance of being selected. Therefore, you cannot estimate the effect of sampling error and there is significant risk of ending ip with a non-representative sample that produces non-generalizable results.
- Probability sampling tends to be more time-consuming and expensive. Non-probability sampling is usually used for exploratory research and hypothesis generation. Many experiments will start out with non-probability and use probability if interesting results are seen.

# Types of probability sampling

### Simple Random Sample (SRS):

- Each possible case has the same chance of being selected. There is no implied connection between the cases in the sample.
- Good way to ensure representative of the population.
- It is still possible for a SRS to not be representative, but this is rare for large samples.

### Stratified Sampling

- The population is divided into non-overlapping groups called **strata** such that each group has some characteristic in common.
- A SRS is taken from each stratum.
- This is useful if you want to ensure equal representation from certain groups: ex. split population into men and women and then take a SRS of both.
- Improves accuracy and representativeness of the results by reducing sampling bias.
- It requires knowledge of the appropriate characteristics to stratify by.

### Cluster Sampling

- Group observations into representative clusters. Each cluster is a heterogeneous group that is a "microcosm" of the population.
- You then randomly sample a few of the clusters and observe all elements in the chosen cluster.
- This works well if there is a lot of variability within each cluster and very little between each cluster.
- Example: if you want to estimate the proportion of elementary school students in Michigan who eat school-provided lunches. You don't want to have to go to every school to check a couple kids, so you can cluster kids by school. You can then survey all the kids in a few schools you randomly select.
- Disadvantage: there is an increased risk of bias if the clusters are different.

### Systematic Sampling

- Works well when the population can be ordered in some way that is unrelated to the variables you are studying.
- You sample every nth person from the list
- Example: sample every 10th person from an alphabetical roster of all Stats 250 students.
- To make it random, you can start the systematic selection from a random individual (select a random number between 1 and 10 and start from there).

### Convenience Samples

- Samples obtained by measuring whatever or whoever is available to be measured.
- This is an example of non-probability sampling. It is rarely representative of the entire population.
- Ex: a professor asking her students to do a study for extra credit. This only generalizes to college students who want extra credit.

# Bias

- Don't want our sampling method to be biased
- Results are biased if the method used to obtain those results would consistently produce values too low or too high.
- "Bias is the bane of sampling - the one thing above all to avoid."

**Selection Bias:** occurs if the method for selecting the partipants produces a sample that does not represent the population of interest.

**Nonresponse bias:** when a representative sample is chosen for a survey, but a subset cannot be contacted or choses not to respond.

**Response bias:** occurs when participants answer differently from how they truly feel. This can be caused by the wording of questions, the way the interviewer behaves, and other factors.

**Sampling bias:** a type of bias that occurs if the method fro selecting the participants causes some individuals in the population to be more or less likely to be included in the sample than others.
