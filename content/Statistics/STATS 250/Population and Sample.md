- To answer research questions, it is usually not feasible to observe every individual/item in the population. This would be too costly and in some cases it is necessary to destroy the item in the process of measurement (ex. ensuring food quality).
- Instead of measuring every item in a population, we take a sample, a subset of the cases that is often a very small fraction of the overall population.
- Statistical inference is the process of using sample information to draw inference about a population.

To make an inference from a sample for a population:

- Collect data in a way that provides unbiased information about the population
- Consider a statistical model for the population so that the properties of the population can be investigated in an appropriate manner.
- Decide what statistical methodologies to apply.

### Anecdotal Evidence

This is typically composed of unusual cases that are recalled based on striking characteristics. Instead of using the few unusual cases to draw conclusions about a population, we should examine a sample of various cases from this population and be cautious about making inferences.

### Golden Rule for Data Collection:

In order to draw inferences about a population from a sample of data, we must be reasonable sure that the sample is representative of the population it came from.

- Representative samples allow us to generalize the results from the sample to the population
- It is best to select samples at random
