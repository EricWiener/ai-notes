# Terminology

![[Lecture 1 /Screen_Shot 4.png]]

- Each row in the table represents one single-family home. This is a **case**.
- The columns represent characteristics, called **variables**, for each home.
- The full table is called a **data matrix.**

### Types of variables

![[Lecture 1 /Screen_Shot 5.png]]

- **Numerical** variables take on a wide range of numerical value and it is sense to do math with (addition, subtraction, averaging)
    - **Discrete:** can only take numerical values with jumps (# of dogs)
    - **Continuous:** when it can take any value in an interval or collection of intervals. Some variables like income are treated as continuous even when they take on distinct values.
    - You can turn numerical values into categorical ones by grouping them, but you can't do the reverse.
- **Categorical** variables place an individual or item into one of several groups or categories, which are called **levels**.
    - **Nominal:** brand of soda is a good example. There is no specific ranking.
    - **Ordinal:** there is a ranking to the levels. Example: small, medium, large.
- Note that the sample size is not considered a variable.
