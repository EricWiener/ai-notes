### Observational Studies vs Experiments

- Observational studies: researchers collect data in a way that does not interfere with how the data arises
- Experiments: researchers directly influence the process by which data arise. Usually involves assigning subjects to one or more treatments. In medical research, experiments are usually referred to as trials.

### Observational studies

- Want to look at the relationship between two or more variables
- **Explanatory** variable is called the independent variable (or predictor)
- The **response** variable is called the independent variable (or outcome).

- Example: whether babies slept with a night light (predictor) affects if they had bad eyesight (outcome).

### Experiments

- Randomized controlled experiments is considered the best.
- Sometimes it is not ethical to conduct a trial, so you need to use observational studies.

### Confounding variables

- A confounding variable is a variable that is associated with both the explanatory and response variables.
- They get in the way of being able to make casual conclusions about the relationship between explanatory and response variables.
- There is no guarantee that all confounding variables can be measured or even easily identified. Experiments can be used to overcome this.
- Sometimes even experiments can have confounding variables if you don't randomize your experiment.

### Causality and association

- Causality: asymmetrical (one-way) relationship between two variables.
- Association: symmetrical (two-way) relationship between two variables
- In short, observational studies are good at showing that a relationship exists. It is difficult to use data from observational studies to show why a relationship exists.
