### Randomized controlled experiments

- Many questions involve cause-and-effect relationships
- In observational studies it is difficult to demonstrate causal relationships because of confounding variables.
- Randomized controlled experiments can more effectively demonstrate a causal connection between variables.
- Researchers randomly assign treatments to different cases, and observe the treatment's effect.

# Principles of experimental design

### 1. Controlling

- It is important to have a control group to compare results against something you already understand (do nothing).
- You can have more than one treatment group.
- A single blind study: the participant isn't aware what group they are in. This is often done through giving placebos.
- Double blind study: you hide the identities of whose in what group to the researchers as well.

### 2. Randomization

- You need to randomly assign treatments
- This is done to even out possible confounding variables

### 3. Replication

- The larger the experiment (more cases), the better.

### 4. Blocking

- Blocking also tries to address the issue of confounding variables.
- You can split cases into categories and then randomly assign treatments within the blocks.
- This helps you decide whether something is a confounding variable.
