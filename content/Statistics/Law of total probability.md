summary: law behind marginalization

The law can be expressed as:
$$P(A)=\sum_n P\left(A \cap B_n\right)$$
or as:
$$P(A)=\sum_n P\left(A \mid B_n\right) P\left(B_n\right)$$
which are equivalent via the [[Definition of Conditional Probability]].

Note: the operation of a weighted sum over other variables is often called a **convolution.**
