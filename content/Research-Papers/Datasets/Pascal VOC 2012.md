The training data provided consists of a set of images; each image has an annotation file giving a bounding box and object class label for each object in one of the twenty classes present in the image. Note that multiple objects from multiple classes may be present in the same image. Annotation was performed according to a set of guidelines distributed to all annotators.

A subset of images are also annotated with pixel-wise segmentation of each object present, to support the segmentation competition.
