In the above image it shows:
a. An image from the dataset
b. Object segementation using a pairwise CRF
c. Segmentation result using pairwise CRF + higher order potentials defined on image segments.
d. The rough hand labelled segmentation.
 
### Accuracy Evaluation
Typically the performance of a segmentation algorithm is measured by counting the total number of mislabelled pixels in the image. We believe this measure is not appropriate for measuring the segmentation accuracy if the user is interested in obtaining accurate segmentations as alpha mattes with fine object boundaries. As only a small fraction of image pixels lie on the boundary of an object, a large qualitative improvement in the quality of the segmentation will result in only a small increase in the percentage pixel-wise accuracy.

Instead, they evaluate the quality of a segmentation by counting the number of pixels misclassified in the region surrounding the actual object boundary and not over the entire image.

The first column shows some images from the MSRC dataset. The **ground truth segmentations** of these image are shown in column 2. Column 3 shows the **trimaps used for measuring the pixel labelling accuracy.** The evaluation region is coloured gray and was generated by taking an 8 pixel band surrounding the boundaries of the objects. The **corresponding trimaps for an evaluation band width of 16 pixels is shown in column 4**.
