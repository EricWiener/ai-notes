- Problem with a 3D grid of points is that you face computational + memory complexities. Can alleviate by making voxels larger, but then you get discretization affects.
- Range view (aka perspective point cloud) works better than birds eye view for tall and thin objects.

- On the left is the top-down view. On the right is a range view. Each row is discretized elevation angle.
- 2D kernels donâ€™t work well for range view.
- They propose new kernels to replace 2D kernels.
    - Dense kernel
    - Other three are like graph neural network kernels
    -
