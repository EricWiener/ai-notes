The passes are tagged: #pass-zero #pass-one, #pass-two, #pass-three
# Zero Pass
- You either haven't read the paper or forgot what it's about

# First Pass
- get a bird’s-eye view of the paper. You can also decide whether you need to do any more passes. This pass should take about five to ten minutes.

# Second Pass
- Read the paper with greater care, but ignore details such as proofs

# Third Pass
- The key to the third pass is to attempt to virtually re-implement the paper: that is, making the same assumptions as the authors, re-create the work. By comparing this re-creation with the actual paper, you can easily identify not only a paper’s innovations, but also its hidden failings and assumptions.
