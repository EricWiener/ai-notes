This paper studies extractable memorization: training data that an adversary can efficiently extract by querying a machine learning model without prior knowledge of the training dataset.

### Discoverable Memorization
Unlike discoverable memorization ([[Research-Papers/Quantifying Memorization Across Neural Language Models|Quantifying Memorization Across Neural Language Models]]) that captures an upper bound on all training data that is memorized (even if it can only be recovered by prompting the model with other training data), extractable memorization captures only that data that can be efficiently recovered by an adversary.
